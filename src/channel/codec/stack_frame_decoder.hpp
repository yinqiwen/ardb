         * In a stream-based transport such as TCP/IP, packets can be fragmented and reassembled
         * during transmission even in a LAN environment. For example, let us assume you have
         * received three packets:
         *
         *  +-----+-----+-----+
         *  | ABC | DEF | GHI |
         *  +-----+-----+-----+
         * because of the packet fragmentation, a server can receive them like the following:
         *  +----+-------+---+---+
         *  | AB | CDEFG | H | I |
         *  +----+-------+---+---+

         * FrameDecoder helps you defrag the received packets into one or more meaningful frames
         * that could be easily understood by the application logic. In case of the example above,
         * your FrameDecoder implementation could defrag the received packets like the following:
         *  +-----+-----+-----+
         *  | ABC | DEF | GHI |
         *  +-----+-----+-----+
